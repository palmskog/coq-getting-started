Coq Resources and Documentation
===============================

A classic but somewhat outdated book on Coq is available on Springer Link: http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-662-07964-5

A newer but less conventional book (and its Coq sources) is also available: http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/

UPenn provides documentation and Coq sources (with exercises) for its Coq-based course on software foundations: https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/index.html
